# WhatsappAPI

**WhatsappAPI is a simple and lightweight library for building WhatsApp bots using the WhatsApp Cloud API.**

**Please note: This project is a work in progress (WIP), and there will be breaking changes in future releases that will be released soon.**

# installation

```bash
npm i whapis
```

# Setup and Usage

```js
const { Whatsapp } = require("whapis");

const serverToWebhook = require("express")();
serverToWebhook.listen(3000);

const Client = new Whatsapp(phoneID, Token, verifyToken, serverToWebhook);

Client.on("messages", async (msg) => {
  if (msg.body === "ping") await msg.reply("pong");
});

Client.on("updates", async (update) => {});

```

# listening
The Whatsapp object exposes two listeners:

The messages listener emits an event when a message is received, whether it's a text message or media message.
The updates listener emits an event when an update message is received. For example, when a message is sent, received, read, or deleted by the user.
Listening to these events is straightforward and can be done using the ``` client.on("event-name") ``` method. The listener emits a single object that can be received as a callback.

# Client:
The `Whatsapp` object exposes the following functions:

- `sendMessage`: This function is used to send a message. It accepts parameters for text or media, as well as a phone number. It sends the message to the client and returns an object with the message ID.

- `uploadMedia`: The `uploadMedia` function receives information returned from the `downloadMedia` function when a media message is received. It uploads the media to WhatsApp. Optionally, you can pass a second boolean parameter indicating whether to save the file in the file system. The function returns the media ID (which is later sent in a media message to the client). If the second parameter is `true`, it also returns the path to the file in the file system.

- `deleteMedia`: This function takes the media ID of the uploaded media and deletes it from WhatsApp's servers. It returns a success status.

# Objects:

**Message Object Contents:**
- `from` - Sender's phone number (string)
- `nameOfFrom` - Sender's name (string)
- `body` - Message body (string). In the case of media messages, it contains an object with additional information.
- `msgID` - Message ID (string)
- `yourNumber` - Your phone number (string)
- `phoneNunerID` - Your phone's identifier (string)
- `time` - Message timestamp (date)
- `type` - Message type. In the case of media messages, it specifies the type of media (e.g., document, image, contact, etc.) (string)
- `hasMedia` - Does the message contain media? (boolean)
- `isReply` - Is the message a reply to another message? (boolean)
- `contacts` - If it's a reply, this object contains the ID of the replied-to message (object)
- `noText` - In case the message does not contain text (boolean)

**The object also exposes the following functions:**
- `reply` - Used to reply to the message, allowing text or media replies (details below).
- `sendToNum` - Sending a message to a specific number, not as a reply. It accepts text or media.
- `markAsRead` - Marks the message as read.
- `fastEmojiResponse` - Provides a quick response using an emoji as a reply. It only accepts emojis.
- `downloadMedia` - Used to download media when dealing with media messages. Important: You should check if the media download was successful, or you will receive an error.

Object `update` content:
- `msgID`: The ID of the message for which the update is received (string).
- `phoneNumberID`: Your phone's identifier (string).
- `status`: The status of the update (e.g., message sent, read, etc.) (string).
- `time`: The timestamp of when the message was received (date).
- `recipient_id`: The ID of the recipient (string).
- `pricing`: If the message involves payment, it contains an object with payment details (module, status, etc.). Otherwise, it contains an object with a `pricing` key indicating no payment is required (string).

This object does not expose any functions.


**The continuation of documentation and development will be uploaded gradually. In the near future, I hope to upload several libraries, so stay tuned! ðŸ˜ƒ**
